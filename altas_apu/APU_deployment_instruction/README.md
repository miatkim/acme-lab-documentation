# APU testing

This folder contains 5 projects that related to Altas APU (algorithm Processing Unit) development.
The developers could use this these 5 projects as reference for developing APU. 

- Project1: A toy APU sample 
- Project2: An APU sample that contains a dense neural network model
- Project3: APU adaptors, convert the orginal signals from GEP to AXI protocol signals. Developers could use the adaptor if they wish developing APU following the AXI protocol
- Project4: A toy APU sample following the AXI protocol
- Project5: A APU sample that contains a CNN model. This APU is following the AXI protocol
